// 3) Unsigned Data Types in C++:

/* 
By default, the data types are signed means we can store both positive and negative data in the variable but we can change it as it as an unsigned as follows.
*/

#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
  unsigned int a = 6;
  cout<<a<<endl;
  return 0;
